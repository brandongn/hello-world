Hello Coders 

I am a little new to this tech world but found my love for it while I was transitioning out of the military. After building my own gaming PC I was hooked on wanted to learn more. I know a bit about the hardware and want to learn about all the software and why somethings happen on websites or how to make things move or work on the web. I look forward to making some great projects and hopefully one day being able to help others wanting to learn.
